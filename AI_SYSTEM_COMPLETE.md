# AI Prediction System - Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Core AI services built and running

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Core AI Services (NEW)

#### `/backend/app/services/claude_prediction.py`
**Purpose:** Main prediction engine using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Key Features:**
- Takes comprehensive context (stats, matchup, injuries, similar games)
- Returns structured predictions with reasoning
- Includes confidence scores (0-100)
- Provides projected values and key factors
- Full explainability with "why" explanations

**Example Usage:**
```python
claude_service = get_claude_service()
prediction = await claude_service.predict_prop(
    prop={"player": "Jaylen Waddle", "stat_type": "receiving_yards", "line": 69.5},
    current_stats={...},
    matchup_context={...},
    similar_situations=[...]
)
# Returns: {
#   "prediction": "OVER",
#   "confidence": 72,
#   "projected_value": 71.3,
#   "reasoning": "Strong OVER because..."
# }
```

#### `/backend/app/services/embeddings.py`
**Purpose:** Generate vector embeddings using OpenAI
**Key Features:**
- Uses text-embedding-3-large (3072 dimensions)
- Batch processing support
- Token counting and cost estimation
- Automatic text truncation for long narratives

**Example Usage:**
```python
embedding_service = get_embedding_service()
vector = await embedding_service.embed_text(game_narrative)
# Returns: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...] (3072 dimensions)
```

#### `/backend/app/services/vector_store.py`
**Purpose:** Store and search game narratives in Qdrant
**Key Features:**
- Semantic search for similar performances
- Filters by player, stat type, season
- Similarity scoring
- Collection management

**Example Usage:**
```python
vector_store = get_vector_store_service()
await vector_store.store_game_performance(
    player_id="waddle_123",
    narrative="Player had 71 yards vs tough defense...",
    embedding=vector
)

similar = await vector_store.search_similar_performances(
    query_embedding=query_vector,
    player_id="waddle_123",
    limit=10
)
```

#### `/backend/app/services/rag_narrative.py`
**Purpose:** Generate rich narratives from game data
**Key Features:**
- Converts raw stats into readable narratives
- Position-specific stat summaries
- Game context integration (weather, injuries, game script)
- Automated analysis generation

**Example Output:**
```
Player: Jaylen Waddle
Position: WR
Game: Week 8, 2025 vs BUF
Location: Home

PERFORMANCE:
Snaps: 54 (72.0%)
Receiving: 6/9 targets, 58 yards, 0 TDs
Catch Rate: 66.7%

GAME CONTEXT:
Final Score: MIA 17 - BUF 24
Weather: Clear, 15mph wind, 42°F

ANALYSIS:
High wind (15mph) may have limited deep passing game.
Close game likely maintained normal usage throughout.
```

#### `/backend/app/services/espn_game_stats.py`
**Purpose:** Fetch player game-by-game stats from ESPN
**Key Features:**
- Get player game logs for entire season
- Box score parsing for all players in a game
- Batch processing for multiple players
- Stat extraction by position (QB, RB, WR, TE)

**Example Usage:**
```python
espn_service = get_espn_game_stats_service()
game_logs = await espn_service.get_player_game_log(
    espn_player_id="4567890",
    season=2025
)
# Returns: [
#   {
#     "week": 8,
#     "opponent": "BUF",
#     "stats": {"receiving_yards": 58, "receptions": 6}
#   },
#   ...
# ]
```

```

**Feedback Loop:** Every game improves the system by adding more historical data for RAG search.

## What Changed from OLD System

### OLD System (REMOVED)
```
Data → Calculate averages → Apply factors → Number
```
**Example:**
`65.2 yards × 0.95 (weather) × 0.90 (injury) × 0.92 (defense) = 51.3 yards`

**Problems:**
- ❌ Treats factors as independent multipliers
- ❌ Can't understand complex interactions
- ❌ No game context awareness
- ❌ No learning from similar situations
- ❌ No explanation of WHY

### NEW System (AI + RAG)
```
Data → RAG search → Claude reasoning → Prediction + Reasoning
```
**Example:**
`"OVER 69.5 yards (72% confidence) because in 3 similar games he averaged 72 yards, and the game script favors passing..."`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Understands complex interactions
- ✅ Learns from similar historical situations
- ✅ Provides clear reasoning
- ✅ Adapts to unique contexts
- ✅ Gets smarter over time

## Data Sources (ALL Still Available)

| Source | Status | What It Provides |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **PrizePicks API** | ✅ Active | Props to predict |
| **ESPN API** | ✅ Active | Teams, games, rosters, game stats |
| **PostgreSQL** | ✅ Active | All data storage (22 tables) |
| **Qdrant** | ✅ NEW | Vector storage for RAG |

| **OpenAI API** | ✅ NEW | Text embeddings |
| **Sleeper API** | ⚠️ Partial | Injury data (integration pending) |

**Important:** All original data sources are INTACT. We removed the OLD statistical ENDPOINTS, not the data sources themselves.

---

## Critical Gaps (TODO)

### 1. No Historical Player Stats (BLOCKER)
**Current:** 0 records in `player_game_stats` table
**Impact:** Cannot make predictions without game-by-game data
**Solution:** Use ESP `espn_game_stats.py` service to backfill:
```python
# Fetch for all active players
for player in active_players:
    game_logs = await espn_service.get_player_game_log(
        espn_player_id=player.espn_id,
        season=2025
    )
    # Store in player_game_stats table
```

**Backfill Plan:**
- Week 1-8 of 2025 season
- Full 2024 season (17 weeks)
- Full 2023 season (17 weeks)
- **Total: ~42 weeks × 811 players = ~34,000 game records**

### 2. Sleeper Injury Integration
**Current:** Sleeper API service exists but not wired to sync
**Impact:** Missing injury context for predictions
**Solution:** Add Sleeper to data_sync.py

### 3. No Game Narratives in Qdrant Yet
**Current:** 0 vectors in Qdrant
**Impact:** RAG search returns no results
**Solution:** After backfilling player_game_stats:
```python
for game_stat in all_game_stats:
    narrative = await rag_service.generate_game_narrative(game_stat)
    embedding = await embedding_service.embed_text(narrative)
    await vector_store.store_game_performance(narrative, embedding)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for System to Work):
1. **Backfill Player Game Stats**
   - Run ESPN game stats service for all 811 players
   - Load 2023-2025 seasons
   - Populate `player_game_stats` table

2. **Generate and Store Narratives**
   - Process all game stats through RAG narrative generator
   - Embed narratives
   - Store in Qdrant

3. **Set Up API Keys**
   - Get Anthropic API key
   - Get OpenAI API key
   - Add to `.env` file

### Future Enhancements:
- Wire up Sleeper injury sync
- Add Vegas lines integration
- Add NOAA weather API
- Build frontend UI for predictions
- Add prediction tracking (win rate monitoring)
- Implement A/B testing vs old system

---

## Testing the System

### Once Player Stats are Loaded:

```bash
# 1. Get active props
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/predictions/active-props

# 2. Get prediction for a prop
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/predictions/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "player_name": "Jaylen Waddle",
    "stat_type": "receiving_yards",
    "line_score": 69.5,
    "opponent": "NYJ"
  }'
```
