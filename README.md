# NFL RAG+AI Prop Prediction System

> **Status**: Phase 0 - Data Source Research
> **Started**: October 26, 2025

## Overview

A next-generation NFL prop prediction system using:
- **Vector Database (Qdrant)** for contextual narratives
- **Claude AI** for intelligent reasoning
- **Real-time data** from 20+ sources
- **Hybrid approach**: Rules + AI for optimal accuracy and cost

**Expected Improvement**: 30-50% more accurate than statistics-only systems

## Current Phase: Data Source Research

**Goal**: Research and validate all data sources before building

**Timeline**: Weeks 1-2

**Progress**:
- [ ] ESPN API (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Sleeper API (Day 3)
- [ ] The Odds API (Day 4)
- [ ] Twitter/News (Day 5)
- [ ] Weather APIs (Day 6)
- [ ] NFL Official (Day 7)
- [ ] Advanced Analytics (Days 8-9)
- [ ] Supplemental Sources (Days 10-13)
- [ ] Finalize Research (Day 14)

## Key Principles

1. **Data Accuracy First** - Real-time, validated, fresh data is critical
2. **Research Before Building** - Validate all sources thoroughly first
3. **Cost Optimization** - Use free tools where possible
4. **Hybrid AI** - Rules for obvious cases, Claude for complex reasoning

## Getting Started (After Research)

Research phase must complete before implementation begins.

See [MASTER_PLAN.md](MASTER_PLAN.md) for detailed roadmap.
