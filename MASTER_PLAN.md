# NFL RAG+AI Prop Prediction System - Master Plan

**Created**: October 26, 2025
**Project**: Fresh start RAG-powered prop prediction system using Claude AI
**Status**: Phase 0 - Data Source Research

---

## Executive Summary

Building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that combines:
1. **Vector database (Qdrant)** with comprehensive NFL context (player narratives, situational data, historical patterns)
2. **Claude API** for intelligent reasoning over retrieved context
3. **Hybrid approach**: Structured stats + unstructured context (RAG) + AI reasoning (Claude)

**Expected Impact**: 30-50% improvement in prediction accuracy by adding contextual intelligence that pure statistics miss.

**Key Principles**:
- ‚úÖ **Data accuracy is #1 priority** - Real-time, validated, fresh data
- ‚úÖ **Research before building** - Validate all data sources first
- ‚úÖ **Separate codebase** - Clean slate, no legacy constraints
- ‚úÖ **Cost-effective** - Use free tools where possible (Qdrant), optimize Claude usage

## Architecture Decisions

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant | Free, Python-native, production-ready |
| **Structured DB** | PostgreSQL | Reliable, proven for structured data |
| **AI Reasoning** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Best reasoning, cost-effective |
| **Embeddings** | OpenAI text-embedding-3-large | High quality, affordable |
| **Backend** | FastAPI + Python 3.11 | Async, modern, fast |
| **Data Updates** | 15-30 min polling | Real-time enough, cost-effective |
| **AI Strategy** | Hybrid (60% rules, 40% Claude) | Cost optimization |

---

## Current Phase: Phase 0 - Data Source Research

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Goal**: Research and validate EVERY data source before building
**Status**: Planning complete, ready to execute

### Research Approach

For each data source, we will:
1. Make real API calls
2. Document exact response schemas
3. Save sample JSON responses
4. Test rate limits
5. Verify data quality
6. Assess uniqueness/value
7. Make go/no-go decision
8. Plan integration strategy

**Day 1-2: ESPN API** üî¥ START HERE
```bash
# Test these endpoints:
curl "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard"
curl "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/teams"

```markdown
# [Source Name]

## Overview
- **Purpose**: What we use this for
- **Access Method**: API / Scraping / Manual
- **Cost**: Free / $X per month
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time / Hourly / Daily
- **Reliability**: High / Medium / Low
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Approved / ‚ùå Rejected / üü° Under Review

## Authentication
- API Key Required: Yes/No
- Rate Limits: X requests per minute
- Sign-up Process: [steps]

## Endpoints Documented

### Endpoint 1: [Name]
- **URL**: `https://...`
- **Method**: GET/POST
- **Parameters**:
  - `param1` (required): Description
  - `param2` (optional): Description
- **Rate Limit**: X/min
- **Response Time**: Avg Xms

**Sample Request**:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://..." \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
  "player_id": 123,
  "name": "Tyreek Hill",
  ...
}
```

## Complete Field Reference

| Field Path | Type | Description | Always Present? | Example |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| `player.id` | int | Unique player ID | ‚úÖ | 123 |
| `player.injury_status` | enum | OUT/DOUBTFUL/etc | ‚ùå | "QUESTIONABLE" |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Data Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: 95% of expected fields present
- **Accuracy**: Cross-checked with official sources
- **Timeliness**: Updates within X minutes
- **Issues Found**: [Any problems discovered]

## Usage in RAG System

**Vector Database Narratives**:
- Game performance narratives
- Injury impact stories
- Matchup history summaries

**Structured Database Storage**:
- Player stats (Postgres)
- Injury status (Postgres)
- Real-time alerts (Redis)

**Example Narrative Generated**:
```
"Tyreek Hill vs BAL (Week 8, 2024): Hill dominated with 8 receptions
for 156 yards and 2 TDs. KC was trailing, leading to pass-heavy script
(45 attempts). Hill exploited BAL's Cover-3 scheme running deep posts.
Weather: Clear, 68¬∞F. Hill was questionable (ankle) but full practice Friday."
```

## Code Examples

**Fetch Player Stats**:
```python
import requests

def get_player_stats(player_id):
    url = f"https://api.example.com/players/{player_id}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
```

**Parse Injury Data**:
```python
def parse_injury_status(data):
    return {
        'player_id': data['id'],
        'status': data['injury_status'],
        'type': data.get('injury_type'),
        'updated': data['updated_at']
    }
```

## Integration Plan

**Polling Frequency**:
- Game days: Every 15 minutes
- Off days: Every 30 minutes

**Data Validation**:
- Check required fields present
- Validate enum values
- Cross-reference with other sources
- Alert on conflicts

**Error Handling**:
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Fallback: Use cached data if API down
- Alerts: Notify on repeated failures

## Testing Results

**Rate Limit Testing**:
- Attempted: 100 requests in 1 minute
- Result: Rate limited at 60 requests
- Confirmed limit: 60/minute

**Data Freshness Testing**:
- Monitored Patrick Mahomes injury update
- ESPN updated: 2:45 PM
- This API updated: 2:48 PM
- Lag: ~3 minutes ‚úÖ Acceptable

**Edge Cases**:
- Missing injury_type field for 12% of injuries
- Playoff games have different format
- Historical data only available since 2020

## Decision

‚úÖ **APPROVED** - Will use for primary player stats and injuries

**Rationale**:
- Free and reliable
- Good data coverage
- Acceptable update frequency
- Essential for MVP

**Alternatives Considered**:
- [Source X]: Rejected due to cost
- [Source Y]: Too slow to update
```
