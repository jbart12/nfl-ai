# Opportunities Discovery System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully transformed the NFL AI system from search-based to **discovery-first** with automated prediction generation and an opportunities feed.

## What Was Built

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- **File**: `backend/app/models/nfl.py`
- **Migration**: `backend/alembic/versions/002_expand_predictions_table.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added 16 new columns to predictions table
  - Player context: `player_name`, `player_position`, `team`, `opponent`
  - Game info: `week`, `season`, `game_time`
  - Prop details: `stat_type`, `line_score`, `edge`
  - Analysis: `key_factors`, `risk_factors`, `comparable_game`
  - Status: `is_active`, `is_archived`, `updated_at`
  - Added 9 indexes for efficient querying

#### 2. Prediction Storage
- **File**: `backend/app/api/endpoints/predictions.py`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/predictions/predict`
- **Enhancement**: Now automatically saves all predictions to database
- **Fields Stored**: Complete prediction with edge calculation, reasoning, factors

#### 3. Opportunities Discovery API
- **File**: `backend/app/api/endpoints/predictions.py`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/predictions/opportunities`
- **Features**:
  - Filter by: position, stat_type, min_confidence, min_edge
  - Sort by: edge, confidence, game_time
  - Returns only active, non-archived predictions
  - Response format: `{opportunities: [...], count: N, filters_applied: {...}}`

#### 4. Batch Prediction Service
- **File**: `backend/app/services/batch_predictions.py`
- **Class**: `BatchPredictionService`
- **Features**:
  - Defines NOTABLE_PROPS for each position:
    - QB: passing_yards [225.5, 250.5, 275.5], passing_touchdowns [1.5, 2.5]
    - RB: rushing_yards [50.5, 75.5, 100.5], rushing_touchdowns [0.5], receptions [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]
    - WR: receiving_yards [50.5, 75.5, 100.5], receptions [3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5]
    - TE: receiving_yards [35.5, 50.5, 65.5], receptions [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]
  - Generates predictions for all props for all active players
  - Skips existing predictions (no duplicates)
  - Rate limiting: 0.5s between predictions
  - Full RAG integration with historical context

#### 5. Automated Scheduler
- **File**: `backend/scripts/run_prediction_scheduler.py`
- **Features**:
  - Runs every 6 hours by default (configurable)
  - Fetches current NFL week/season from Sleeper API
  - Generates predictions for all upcoming games
  - Error recovery with 30-minute retry
  - Command-line options:
    - `--once`: Run once and exit
    - `--interval N`: Set custom interval in hours

### Frontend Components

#### 1. OpportunityCard Component
- **File**: `frontend/components/opportunities/OpportunityCard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Clean card layout with player, team, matchup info
  - Prominent edge display with color coding:
    - Green: edge >= 10
    - Emerald: edge >= 5
    - Blue: edge >= 2
    - Gray: edge < 2
  - Confidence meter with visual indicator
  - OVER/UNDER badge (green for OVER, red for UNDER)
  - Expandable details section:
    - Full AI reasoning
    - Key factors (green highlights)
    - Risk factors (red highlights)
    - Comparable game reference
    - Generation timestamp

#### 2. OpportunityFilters Component
- **File**: `frontend/components/opportunities/OpportunityFilters.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Position filter: QB, RB, WR, TE
  - Stat type filter: All major stats (passing/rushing/receiving)
  - Confidence slider: 0-100%
  - Edge slider: 0-20
  - Sort by: Edge, Confidence, Game Time
  - Active filter count
  - Clear all button

#### 3. Opportunities Page
- **File**: `frontend/app/opportunities/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time API integration
  - Loading state with spinner
  - Error state with retry button
  - Empty state with helpful message
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Shows count of opportunities
  - Auto-refreshes when filters change

#### 4. Navigation & Home Updates
- **Files**: `frontend/app/layout.tsx`, `frontend/app/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added header navigation (Opportunities, Predict)
  - Updated home page hero with "View Opportunities" primary CTA
  - Revised features grid to highlight automated discovery
  - Updated "How It Works" for discovery-first workflow
  - Search/Predict remains available as secondary feature

#### 5. API Client & Types
- **Files**: `frontend/lib/api.ts`, `frontend/types/index.ts`
- **Functions**: `fetchOpportunities(filters)`
- **Types**: `Opportunity`, `OpportunityFilters`

## How to Use

### 1. View Opportunities Feed
```bash
# Navigate to http://localhost:13000
# Click "Opportunities" in navigation or "View Opportunities" button
```

### 2. Generate Predictions Manually
```bash
# Generate for specific week (limited players for testing)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:18000/api/v1/predictions/generate-batch?week=9&season=2025&max_players=10"

# Generate for entire week (all players)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:18000/api/v1/predictions/generate-batch?week=9&season=2025"
```

### 3. Start Automated Scheduler
```bash
# One-time run (useful for testing)
cd backend
python -m scripts.run_prediction_scheduler --once

# Continuous mode (every 6 hours)
python -m scripts.run_prediction_scheduler

# Custom interval (every 4 hours)
python -m scripts.run_prediction_scheduler --interval 4
```

### 4. Query Opportunities API Directly
```bash
# Get all opportunities
curl "http://localhost:18000/api/v1/predictions/opportunities"

# Filter by position
curl "http://localhost:18000/api/v1/predictions/opportunities?position=QB"

# High-confidence, high-edge opportunities
curl "http://localhost:18000/api/v1/predictions/opportunities?min_confidence=70&min_edge=5.0"

# Sort by confidence
curl "http://localhost:18000/api/v1/predictions/opportunities?sort_by=confidence"
```

## Database Queries

### Check Prediction Count
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM predictions WHERE is_active = true;
```

### View Top Opportunities
```sql
SELECT player_name, player_position, stat_type, line_score,
       prediction, confidence, edge
FROM predictions
WHERE is_active = true
ORDER BY edge DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Opportunities by Position
```sql
SELECT player_position, COUNT(*),
       AVG(edge)::numeric(10,2) as avg_edge,
       AVG(confidence)::numeric(10,2) as avg_confidence
FROM predictions
WHERE is_active = true
GROUP BY player_position
ORDER BY avg_edge DESC;
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Edge Calculation
```python
edge = projected_value - line_score
```
- Positive edge = good value (projected > line)
- Negative edge = avoid (projected < line)
- Sorted DESC by default (best opportunities first)

### RAG Integration
- Each prediction uses historical game narratives
- Finds similar situations using Qdrant vector search
- Enriches AI analysis with comparable performances
- Stored as `similar_situations_count` in database

### Prediction Lifecycle
1. **Generation**: Batch service creates predictions for upcoming games
2. **Storage**: Saved to database with `is_active=true`
3. **Discovery**: Opportunities API surfaces best predictions
4. **Display**: Frontend shows in sortable/filterable feed
5. **Archive**: After game completion, set `is_archived=true`

## Notable Props Configuration

Located in `backend/app/services/batch_predictions.py`:

```python
NOTABLE_PROPS = {
    "QB": {
        "passing_yards": [225.5, 250.5, 275.5],
        "passing_touchdowns": [1.5, 2.5],
        "interceptions": [0.5, 1.5],
    },
    "RB": {
        "rushing_yards": [50.5, 75.5, 100.5],
        "rushing_touchdowns": [0.5],
        "receptions": [2.5, 3.5, 4.5],
    },
    # ... WR, TE
}
```

These represent common betting lines. Modify this dict to add/remove props or change thresholds.

## System Status

✅ **Backend**: All 5 components complete
✅ **Frontend**: All 5 components complete
✅ **API Integration**: Working
✅ **Database Migration**: Applied
✅ **Docker Setup**: Running
✅ **Test Predictions**: Generated

## Current Data

- **Week 8**: 22 predictions generated (backup players)
- **Week 9**: Generating predictions for starters (in progress)
- **Total Active Opportunities**: Check with `COUNT(*)` query above

## Next Steps

1. **Let batch generation complete** for week 9 (takes 5-10 minutes)
2. **View opportunities feed** at http://localhost:13000/opportunities
3. **Filter and explore** to find best betting opportunities
4. **Set up scheduler** to run every 6 hours for automated updates
5. **Archive old predictions** after games complete (manual for now)

## Production Deployment

For production, consider:
1. Run scheduler as a background service (systemd, supervisor, or Docker container)
2. Add webhook/cron to archive predictions after game completion
3. Set up monitoring for scheduler failures
4. Adjust `NOTABLE_PROPS` based on actual sportsbook lines
5. Add rate limiting to API endpoints
6. Consider pagination for large opportunity sets
