---

## üéØ Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Start the Automated Scheduler** (Most Important)
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m scripts.run_prediction_scheduler --interval 6
   ```
   This will generate predictions every 6 hours automatically.

2. **Generate Predictions for Key Starters**
   - Current predictions are mostly backup players
   - Generate predictions for star players:
   ```bash
   # Generate for entire week 9 (all active players)
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:18000/api/v1/predictions/generate-batch?week=9&season=2025"
   ```

3. **Test the Full Workflow**
   - Visit opportunities feed
   - Apply various filters
   - Expand prediction details
   - Verify all data displays correctly

4. **Archive Old Predictions**
   - After games complete, mark predictions as archived:
   ```sql
   UPDATE predictions
   SET is_archived = true, is_active = false
   WHERE week < 9 AND is_completed = true;
   ```

### Future Enhancements

1. **Automatic Archival**
   - Add cron job or scheduler task to archive predictions after game completion
   - Could check game status and auto-archive

2. **Prediction Accuracy Tracking**
   - After games complete, compare predictions to actual results
   - Update `actual_value` and `was_correct` fields
   - Build accuracy dashboard

3. **Sportsbook Integration**
   - Fetch real lines from sportsbooks
   - Replace NOTABLE_PROPS with live data
   - Alert on line movements

4. **Enhanced Filtering**
   - Filter by team
   - Filter by opponent
   - Filter by game time (today, tomorrow, this week)
   - Show only positive edge opportunities

5. **Notification System**
   - Email/SMS alerts for high-edge opportunities
   - Slack/Discord webhooks
   - Push notifications

6. **Mobile Responsive Optimization**
   - Current layout is responsive but could be optimized
   - Consider mobile-first card design

7. **Performance Tracking**
   - Track which props have best prediction accuracy
   - Adjust confidence weights based on historical performance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Reminders

### Known Issues
1. **Worker Container Restarting**
   - Status: Not critical for opportunities system
   - The worker service is failing but doesn't affect prediction generation or API
   - Can investigate if needed, but system works without it

2. **Negative Edge Values**
   - Most current predictions have negative edge
   - Reason: Test data with backup/depth players who have limited stats
   - Will improve with starter player predictions

3. **No Game Times**
   - Many predictions have `game_time: null`
   - Games may not have scheduled times in database yet
   - Check `games` table and update as needed

### Edge Calculation Clarification
```python
edge = projected_value - line_score

# Examples:
# Projected 280 yards, Line 250.5 ‚Üí Edge = +29.5 (GREAT)
# Projected 240 yards, Line 250.5 ‚Üí Edge = -10.5 (AVOID)
```

- **Positive edge** = Projected exceeds line = Good betting opportunity
- **Negative edge** = Projected below line = Avoid (or bet opposite)
- **Zero edge** = Fair line, no value

### Rate Limiting
- Batch service has 0.5s delay between predictions
- This prevents API overload
- Generating 100 predictions takes ~50 seconds
- Adjust in `batch_predictions.py` if needed

### Database Maintenance
```sql
-- Check prediction count by week
SELECT week, COUNT(*)
FROM predictions
WHERE is_active = true
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;

-- Archive old predictions
UPDATE predictions
SET is_active = false, is_archived = true
WHERE week < CURRENT_WEEK AND game_time < NOW();

-- Delete test predictions (if needed)
DELETE FROM predictions WHERE player_name = 'Test Player';
```

## üí° Tips for Next Session

1. **Start Here:**
   - Check `docker-compose ps` to see all services
   - Visit http://localhost:13000/opportunities to see current state
   - Check prediction count: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM predictions WHERE is_active = true`

2. **If Opportunities Feed is Empty:**
   - Generate more predictions with batch endpoint
   - Check database for predictions: `SELECT * FROM predictions LIMIT 5`
   - Verify API endpoint: `curl http://localhost:18000/api/v1/predictions/opportunities`

3. **If You Need Fresh Data:**
   - Find active starters with stats in database
   - Generate predictions for specific teams/weeks
   - Use `max_players` parameter to limit initial generation

4. **For Production Deployment:**
   - Review `OPPORTUNITIES_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` section on production
   - Set up scheduler as systemd service
   - Add monitoring and alerting
   - Configure automatic archival
