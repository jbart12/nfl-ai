- ✅ **7-DAY FORECASTS** - Plan ahead for upcoming games

**Weather Impact on Props:**
- 🌬️ **Wind >15 mph:** ⬇️ Passing yards, ⬇️ FG accuracy, ⬆️ Rush attempts
- 🌧️ **Rain/Snow:** ⬇️ Passing yards, ⬇️ Receptions, ⬆️ Rush attempts, ⬇️ Points
- ❄️ **Cold <32°F:** ⬇️ Passing accuracy, ⬇️ Ball handling
- ☀️ **Dome:** ✅ No weather impact (consistent conditions)

## API Overview

**Provider:** NOAA National Weather Service (weather.gov)

**Base URL:** `https://api.weather.gov`

**Authentication:** None required (public government API)

**Rate Limits:** None officially published (reasonable use expected)

**Data Format:** GeoJSON

**Coverage:** United States only (perfect for NFL)

**Update Frequency:**
- Forecasts: Updated every 1-6 hours
- Current conditions: Real-time
- Hourly forecasts: Available

---

## API Workflow

NOAA/NWS uses a two-step process:

### Step 1: Get Forecast Grid Point
Convert lat/lon to NWS grid point:
```bash
curl "https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}" \
  -H "User-Agent: NFL-AI (contact@example.com)"
```

Returns forecast URLs for that location.

### Step 2: Get Forecast
Use the forecast URL from step 1:
```bash
curl "{forecast_url}" \
  -H "User-Agent: NFL-AI (contact@example.com)"
```

**IMPORTANT:** Must include `User-Agent` header or requests will be rejected.

## Weather Impact Analysis

### Wind Impact (Most Critical for Props)

| Wind Speed | Impact | Affected Props |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **0-10 mph** | ✅ Minimal | Normal conditions |
| **10-15 mph** | ⚠️ Slight | QB passing slightly affected |
| **15-20 mph** | ⚠️ Moderate | ⬇️ Deep passes, ⬇️ FG accuracy |
| **20+ mph** | 🔴 Severe | ⬇️⬇️ Passing yards, ⬇️⬇️ Kicking |

**Example Impact (20+ mph winds):**
- QB Passing Yards: -50 to -100 yards
- Completion %: -5% to -10%
- FG >50 yards: Very unlikely
- Deep passes (>20 yards): Significantly reduced

### Precipitation Impact

| Condition | Impact | Affected Props |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Clear** | ✅ Normal | No adjustments |
| **Light Rain** | ⚠️ Slight | ⬇️ 5-10% passing, ⬆️ fumbles |
| **Heavy Rain** | 🔴 Moderate | ⬇️ 15-25% passing, ⬆️ rushing |
| **Snow** | 🔴 Severe | ⬇️ 25-40% passing, ⬇️ total points |

### Temperature Impact

| Temp | Impact | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **>60°F** | ✅ Normal | Ideal conditions |
| **40-60°F** | ⚠️ Slight | Typical fall football |
| **20-40°F** | ⚠️ Moderate | Ball harder, hands cold |
| **<20°F** | 🔴 Severe | Passing significantly affected |

**Cold Weather Teams:** GB, BUF, CHI, CLE, NE (used to cold)
**Warm Weather Teams:** MIA, TB, JAX, LAC, ARI (struggle in cold)

## Integration Plan

### Priority 1: Pre-Game Weather Fetch (24 hours before)

```python
async def fetch_game_weather(game_time: datetime, stadium_lat: float, stadium_lon: float):
    """
    Fetch weather forecast for a game.

    Call this 24 hours before game time for initial forecast,
    then update every 6 hours as game approaches.
    """
    # Step 1: Get forecast grid point
    point_url = f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{stadium_lat},{stadium_lon}"

    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'NFL-AI (your-email@example.com)',
        'Accept': 'application/json'
    }

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        # Get point data
        async with session.get(point_url, headers=headers) as resp:
            point_data = await resp.json()
            forecast_url = point_data['properties']['forecast']
            forecast_hourly_url = point_data['properties']['forecastHourly']

        # Get forecast
        async with session.get(forecast_hourly_url, headers=headers) as resp:
            forecast_data = await resp.json()

            # Find forecast period matching game time
            game_forecast = find_matching_period(forecast_data, game_time)

            return {
                "temperature": game_forecast["temperature"],
                "wind_speed": parse_wind_speed(game_forecast["windSpeed"]),
                "wind_direction": game_forecast["windDirection"],
                "conditions": game_forecast["shortForecast"],
                "precip_chance": game_forecast["probabilityOfPrecipitation"]["value"],
                "is_precipitation": "rain" in game_forecast["shortForecast"].lower()
                                  or "snow" in game_forecast["shortForecast"].lower(),
            }
```

### Priority 2: Weather-Based Prop Adjustments

```python
def calculate_weather_adjustment(prop: Dict, weather: Dict) -> float:
    """
    Calculate adjustment factor for a prop based on weather.

    Returns multiplier (e.g., 0.9 = reduce by 10%, 1.1 = increase by 10%)
    """
    stat_type = prop["stat_type"]
    wind_speed = weather["wind_speed"]
    temp = weather["temperature"]
    is_precip = weather["is_precipitation"]

    adjustment = 1.0  # Start at no adjustment

    # Passing props
    if "Pass" in stat_type or "Passing" in stat_type:
        # Wind impact
        if wind_speed > 20:
            adjustment *= 0.85  # -15%
        elif wind_speed > 15:
            adjustment *= 0.93  # -7%

        # Precipitation
        if is_precip:
            adjustment *= 0.90  # -10%

        # Cold
        if temp < 32:
            adjustment *= 0.93  # -7%

    # Receiving props
    elif "Rec" in stat_type:
        if wind_speed > 20:
            adjustment *= 0.90
        if is_precip:
            adjustment *= 0.92

    # Rushing props (benefit from bad weather)
    elif "Rush" in stat_type:
        if wind_speed > 15 or is_precip:
            adjustment *= 1.05  # +5% (more rushing in bad weather)

    # Kicking props
    elif "FG" in stat_type or "Kick" in stat_type:
        if wind_speed > 15:
            adjustment *= 0.85  # -15% (kicking heavily affected)

    return adjustment
```

### Priority 3: Weather Data Caching

```python
async def get_cached_weather(stadium_id: str, game_time: datetime) -> Dict:
    """
    Get weather with caching to avoid excessive API calls.

    Cache TTL:
    - >24 hours before game: 6 hour cache
    - <24 hours before game: 1 hour cache
    - <3 hours before game: 30 minute cache
    """
    cache_key = f"weather:{stadium_id}:{game_time.isoformat()}"

    # Check cache
    cached = await redis.get(cache_key)
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)

    # Fetch fresh data
    weather = await fetch_game_weather(...)

    # Set cache TTL based on time until game
    hours_until_game = (game_time - datetime.now()).total_seconds() / 3600
    if hours_until_game > 24:
        ttl = 3600 * 6  # 6 hours
    elif hours_until_game > 3:
        ttl = 3600  # 1 hour
    else:
        ttl = 1800  # 30 minutes

    await redis.setex(cache_key, ttl, json.dumps(weather))

    return weather
```

### Suggested Update Frequencies

| Time Until Game | Fetch Frequency | Reason |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| >48 hours | Skip | Too early, forecast unreliable |
| 24-48 hours | Every 6 hours | Initial forecast |
| 6-24 hours | Every 2 hours | Forecast firming up |
| 1-6 hours | Every 30 minutes | Final conditions |
| <1 hour | Every 15 minutes | Real-time updates |

## Go/No-Go Decision

### ✅ **GO** - NOAA/NWS Weather Service

**Justification:**

1. **Cost:** Completely FREE, no API key required
2. **Coverage:** US-only (perfect for NFL)
3. **Reliability:** Official government weather service
4. **Accuracy:** Professional meteorologists
5. **Data Quality:** Temperature, wind, precipitation, forecasts
6. **Forecasts:** 7-day forecasts with hourly detail

**Why NOAA/NWS is Perfect:**

- All 32 NFL stadiums are in the US
- Government API = reliable, won't shut down
- No rate limits to worry about
- Professional-grade forecasts
- Simple REST API

**Alternative APIs (if needed):**

If NOAA/NWS becomes unavailable or you need global coverage:
1. **WeatherAPI.com:** 1M free calls/month (excellent for backups)
2. **OpenWeatherMap:** 1000 free calls/day
3. **ESPN game data:** Often includes weather in game info

**Role in System:**

- **SUPPLEMENTAL SOURCE** for outdoor game analysis
- **CRITICAL for certain props:** Kicking, passing yards, totals
- **Skip for dome games:** No weather impact

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Research Complete** - NOAA/NWS validated
2. ⏭️ **Build Weather Accessor** (src/data/accessors/weather/)
   - Implement NOAA point lookup + forecast fetch
   - Add stadium location mapping
   - Add caching layer (6-hour to 30-min TTL)
   - Add wind speed parsing

3. ⏭️ **Integrate with Props Analysis**
   - Calculate weather adjustment factors
   - Apply to predictions for outdoor games
   - Add weather context to RAG narratives

4. ⏭️ **Build Stadium Database**
   - Map all 32 stadiums to lat/lon
   - Flag dome vs outdoor
   - Store in database
