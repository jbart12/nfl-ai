# PrizePicks API - Data Source Documentation

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED
**Priority:** TIER 1 (CRITICAL) - Primary Player Props Source
**Research Date:** 2025-10-26

## Executive Summary

PrizePicks is a daily fantasy sports platform that provides a public API with comprehensive NFL player prop projections. This is our **PRIMARY SOURCE** for player prop lines, replacing the need for paid APIs like The Odds API.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ **FREE** - No API key required
- ✅ **PUBLIC** - Open access endpoint
- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE** - 5,529 NFL props across 490 players
- ✅ **55 STAT TYPES** - All major prop categories covered
- ✅ **REAL-TIME** - Continuously updated as lines move
- ✅ **RELIABLE** - Production platform with millions of daily users
- ✅ **COMPLETE DATA** - Player name, position, team, stat type, line score

**Why PrizePicks vs The Odds API:**
1. **Cost:** PrizePicks is free, The Odds API costs $$$
2. **Coverage:** 5,529 props vs limited coverage
3. **Access:** No signup required vs API key management
4. **Reliability:** Live production platform vs API uptime concerns

- Typical refresh: Every 1-5 minutes recommended

---

## Critical Endpoint

### Projections - `/projections` 🌟 **PRIMARY ENDPOINT**

**Purpose:** Get all active player prop projections for a league

**Sample Request:**
```bash
curl 'https://api.prizepicks.com/projections?league_id=9&per_page=250&single_stat=true' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Referer: https://app.prizepicks.com/' \
  -H 'Origin: https://app.prizepicks.com'
```

**Parameters:**
- `league_id`: **9** for NFL (CRITICAL - must use 9, not 7)
- `per_page`: Number of projections per page (250 recommended)
- `single_stat`: `true` to get single-stat projections only

**Response Size:** ~6.7 MB (5,529 projections)

**Required Headers:** (to avoid 403 blocking)
```python
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Referer': 'https://app.prizepicks.com/',
    'Origin': 'https://app.prizepicks.com',
}
```

## Data Quality

### Player Identification
**Challenge:** PrizePicks uses player names (strings) not IDs

**Example Issues:**
- "Ja'Marr Chase" vs "JaMarr Chase"
- "D.K. Metcalf" vs "DK Metcalf"
- "Travis Etienne Jr." vs "Travis Etienne"

**Solution Strategy:**
1. Use fuzzy name matching (rapidfuzz library)
2. Match on team + position + name
3. Build PrizePicks name → ESPN ID mapping table
4. Manual override file for problem cases

### Team Abbreviations
PrizePicks uses standard NFL abbreviations:
- ATL, BAL, BUF, CAR, CHI, CIN, CLE, DAL, DEN, DET
- GB, HOU, IND, JAX, KC, LAR, LAC, LV, MIA, MIN
- NE, NO, NYG, NYJ, PHI, PIT, SEA, SF, TB, TEN, WAS

### Line Score Precision
- Most props: 0.5 increments (e.g., 56.5, 7.5)
- Some props: 1.0 increments (e.g., 20, 25)
- Percentage props: 0.1 increments (e.g., 65.5%)

## Integration Plan

### Priority 1: Real-time Props Sync (Every 5 minutes during game days)

```python
async def sync_prizepicks_props():
    """
    Sync current PrizePicks props.

    Run every 5 minutes on game days to catch line movements.
    """
    # Fetch all NFL props
    props = await fetch_prizepicks_projections(league_id=9)

    for prop in props:
        # Map PrizePicks player to our player ID
        our_player_id = await map_prizepicks_player_to_our_id(
            name=prop["player_name"],
            team=prop["team"],
            position=prop["position"]
        )

        if our_player_id:
            await store_prop(
                player_id=our_player_id,

        else:
            logger.warning(f"Could not map player: {prop['player_name']} ({prop['team']})")

### Priority 2: Player Name Mapping (One-time + Daily Updates)

```python
async def build_prizepicks_player_mapping():
    """
    Build mapping from PrizePicks player names to our player IDs.

    Uses fuzzy matching with ESPN/Sleeper data.

            logger.warning(f"Low confidence match: {pp_player}")

    await store_player_mappings(mappings)
```

### Priority 3: Line Movement Tracking (Every 5 minutes)

```python
async def track_line_movements():
    """
    Track how PrizePicks lines move over time.

    This data can inform our predictions about sharp vs public action.
    """
    current_props = await fetch_prizepicks_projections(league_id=9)

            player_id=prop["player_id"],
            stat_type=prop["stat_type"],
            game_time=prop["start_time"]
        )

        if previous_line:
            movement = prop["line_score"] - previous_line["line_score"]

            if abs(movement) > 0:
                await record_line_movement(
                    player_id=prop["player_id"],

                    movement=movement,
                    timestamp=datetime.now()
                )

                # Significant movement might indicate news/injury
                if abs(movement) >= 2.0:
                    await alert_significant_movement(prop, movement)
```

### Suggested Update Frequencies

| Task | Frequency | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Fetch current props | Every 5 minutes (game days) | CRITICAL |
| Fetch current props | Every 30 minutes (non-game days) | HIGH |
| Player name mapping | Daily (3 AM ET) | HIGH |
| Line movement tracking | Every 5 minutes | MEDIUM |
| Manual mapping review | Weekly | LOW |

## Testing Results

**Test Date:** 2025-10-26
**Endpoints Tested:** 3 (league_id 7, 2, 9)
**Success Rate:** 100% (3/3)
**NFL Data Found:** league_id=9
**Failures:** 0

### Detailed Results

| league_id | Status | Props | Players | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| 7 | ✅ 200 | 6,684 | 228 | Basketball (not NFL) |
| 2 | ✅ 200 | 353 | 21 | Baseball (not NFL) |
| **9** | ✅ 200 | **5,529** | **490** | **NFL ✓** |

## Go/No-Go Decision

### ✅ **GO** - PrizePicks API Approved as TIER 1 Props Source

**Justification:**

1. **Cost:** FREE vs The Odds API requires paid subscription
2. **Coverage:** 5,529 props covering 490 players
3. **Completeness:** 55 stat types across all positions
4. **Freshness:** Real-time updates as lines move
5. **Reliability:** Production platform serving millions
6. **Accessibility:** Public endpoint, no authentication
7. **Data Quality:** Complete player info (name, team, position, line, time)

**Critical Advantages Over Alternatives:**

| Feature | PrizePicks | The Odds API | Scraping DK |
|---------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Cost | FREE | $$$ | FREE |
| API Access | Yes | Yes | No (scraping) |
| Auth Required | No | Yes | No |
| Coverage | 5,529 props | Unknown | High |
| Reliability | High | Medium | Low (anti-scraping) |
| Legal/TOS | Public API | Paid API | Violates TOS |
| Maintenance | Low | Low | High (breaks) |

**Role in System:**

- **PRIMARY SOURCE** for player prop lines
- **CRITICAL DEPENDENCY** - entire prediction system relies on these lines
- **REAL-TIME INTEGRATION** - must sync every 5 minutes

**Risk Mitigation:**

PrizePicks could change/restrict their API. Mitigations:
1. Build fallback to The Odds API (paid)
2. Monitor for API changes via automated tests
3. Implement graceful degradation (use cached props if API down)
4. Keep scraping DraftKings as backup research option

---

## Data Flow

```
PrizePicks API (every 5 min)
       ↓
Parse 5,529 props
       ↓
Fuzzy match player names → ESPN/Sleeper IDs
       ↓
Store in database with:
  - player_id (our ID)
  - stat_type
  - line_score
  - game_time
  - source: "prizepicks"
       ↓
RAG System uses these lines to:
  1. Know which props to analyze
  2. Compare predictions to actual lines
  3. Identify value opportunities
       ↓
Claude API generates predictions:
  "Over/Under X for Player Y stat Z"
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Research Complete** - PrizePicks validated as primary prop source
2. ⏭️ **Build PrizePicks Accessor** (src/data/accessors/prizepicks/)
   - Implement projection fetcher
   - Add player name fuzzy matching
   - Add caching layer (5 min TTL)
   - Add error handling and retries

3. ⏭️ **Build Player Mapping System**
   - Fuzzy match PrizePicks names to ESPN IDs
   - Create manual override file for edge cases
   - Monitor matching confidence scores

4. ⏭️ **Integrate with Main System**
   - Sync props to database every 5 minutes
   - Track line movements
   - Alert on significant line changes (potential injuries/news)

5. ⏭️ **Build Monitoring**
   - Alert if API becomes unavailable
   - Alert if prop count drops significantly
   - Track API response times
