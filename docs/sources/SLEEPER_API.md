## Integration Plan

### Priority 1: Injury Data Sync (Daily + Breaking News)

```python
async def sync_injury_data():
    """
    Sync injury data from Sleeper API.

    Run:
    - Daily at 3 PM ET (after practice reports)
    - On-demand when breaking injury news detected
    """
    players = await fetch_sleeper_players()

    injured_players = [
        p for p in players.values()
        if p.get("injury_status") is not None
    ]

    for player in injured_players:
        await update_player_injury(
            player_id=player["espn_id"],  # Use ESPN ID for our database
            injury_status=player["injury_status"],
            injury_body_part=player.get("injury_body_part"),
            injury_start_date=player.get("injury_start_date"),
            injury_notes=player.get("injury_notes"),
            practice_participation=player.get("practice_participation"),
            practice_description=player.get("practice_description"),
            last_updated=datetime.now()
        )
```

### Priority 2: Player ID Mapping (One-time + Weekly Updates)

```python
async def build_player_id_mapping():
    """
    Build cross-platform player ID mapping.

    Run once at setup, then weekly to catch new players.
    """
    players = await fetch_sleeper_players()

    for sleeper_id, player in players.items():
        await store_player_mapping(
            sleeper_id=sleeper_id,
            espn_id=player.get("espn_id"),
            yahoo_id=player.get("yahoo_id"),
            rotowire_id=player.get("rotowire_id"),
            gsis_id=player.get("gsis_id"),
            name=player["full_name"],
            position=player["position"],
            team=player.get("team")
        )
```

### Priority 3: Depth Chart Tracking (Daily)

```python
async def sync_depth_charts():
    """
    Track depth chart changes for starter/backup analysis.

    Run daily to detect depth chart changes.
    """
    players = await fetch_sleeper_players()

    # Group by team and position
    depth_charts = {}
    for player in players.values():
        if player.get("team") and player.get("depth_chart_position"):
            key = f"{player['team']}_{player['depth_chart_position']}"
            if key not in depth_charts:
                depth_charts[key] = []
            depth_charts[key].append({
                "name": player["full_name"],
                "order": player.get("depth_chart_order", 999),
                "espn_id": player.get("espn_id")
            })

    # Sort by depth chart order
    for key in depth_charts:
        depth_charts[key].sort(key=lambda x: x["order"])

    await store_depth_charts(depth_charts)
```

### Suggested Update Frequencies

| Data Type | Update Frequency | Priority |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Injury Status | Daily 3 PM ET + breaking news | CRITICAL |
| Player Database | Daily | HIGH |
| ID Mapping | Weekly | MEDIUM |
| Depth Charts | Daily | MEDIUM |
| Trending Players | Hourly (during season) | LOW |

## Data Gaps & Limitations

### Missing Data

1. **Game-Level Data** ‚ùå
   - No scores, schedules, or game information
   - **Solution:** Use ESPN API

2. **Player Stats** ‚ùå
   - Stats endpoint returned 404
   - **Solution:** Use ESPN API or build from game data

3. **Projections** ‚ùå
   - Projections endpoint returned 404
   - **Solution:** Generate our own using RAG + Claude

4. **News Articles** ‚ùå
   - No dedicated news endpoint
   - **Solution:** Use ESPN news API or Twitter

5. **Props/Betting Lines** ‚ùå
   - No betting data
   - **Solution:** Use The Odds API or PrizePicks

### Data Quality Issues

1. **Free Agents**
   - Players without teams have incomplete data
   - Missing depth chart info
   - May have stale injury info

2. **Practice Squad**
   - Less detailed injury tracking
   - Depth chart position may be null

3. **Rookies**
   - May be missing some platform IDs
   - Years of experience = 0

## Sample Usage Code

### Injury Data Accessor

```python

## Testing Results

**Test Date:** 2025-10-26
**Endpoints Tested:** 5
**Success Rate:** 60% (3/5)
**Average Response Time:** < 2 seconds (players endpoint is large)
**Failures:** 2 (stats and projections - not critical)

### Detailed Results

| Endpoint | Status | Response Size | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `/state/nfl` | ‚úÖ 200 | 230 B | Current week info |
| `/players/nfl` | ‚úÖ 200 | 14.6 MB | 11,400 players, 1,098 with injuries |
| `/players/nfl/trending/add` | ‚úÖ 200 | 990 B | 25 trending players |
| `/stats/nfl/2024` | ‚ùå 404 | - | Not critical |
| `/projections/nfl/2024` | ‚ùå 404 | - | Not critical |

## Go/No-Go Decision

### ‚úÖ **GO** - Sleeper API Approved as TIER 1 Injury Data Source

**Justification:**

1. **Injury Data Excellence:** 1,098 players with injury status - unmatched coverage
2. **Data Detail:** Injury status, body part, dates, practice participation
3. **ID Mapping:** Cross-platform IDs enable data merging
4. **Depth Charts:** Starter/backup information for context
5. **Reliability:** Fantasy platform requires real-time accuracy
6. **Cost:** Free with no authentication
7. **Performance:** Fast, reliable API

**Role in System:**

- **PRIMARY SOURCE** for injury data
- **SECONDARY SOURCE** for player identification/mapping
- **SUPPLEMENTAL** for depth chart information

**Why 60% Success Rate is Acceptable:**

- The 3 successful endpoints provide all critical data
- Failed endpoints (stats/projections) are available from other sources
- The players endpoint alone justifies using Sleeper
- Quality over quantity - what works is exceptional

**Critical Data Flow:**

```
Sleeper Injury Data ‚Üí Our Database ‚Üí Merge with ESPN Game Data ‚Üí RAG Narratives
       ‚Üì
ESPN Player ID Mapping
       ‚Üì
Unified Player Profile
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Research Complete** - Sleeper API validated
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Build Sleeper Accessor** (src/data/accessors/sleeper/)
   - Implement players endpoint
   - Add caching (14.6 MB response should be cached)
   - Build injury data extractor
   - Build ID mapping system
   - Add depth chart parser

3. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Integration with ESPN:**
   - Use espn_id to map Sleeper injuries to ESPN players
   - Merge injury data into player profiles
   - Build unified player database

4. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Move to Next Source:** The Odds API (prop betting lines)
