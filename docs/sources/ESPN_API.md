## Data Gaps & Limitations

### Missing Data (High Priority)

1. **Player Props** ❌ CRITICAL GAP
   - ESPN API only provides game-level odds (spread, total)
   - No player prop lines (passing yards, TDs, receptions, etc.)
   - **Impact:** Need separate source for prop odds (PrizePicks, DraftKings, or The Odds API)

2. **Detailed Player Game Logs** ⚠️
   - Individual player game history not readily available
   - May need to parse from game events
   - **Workaround:** Build from scoreboard data over time

3. **Advanced Stats** ⚠️
   - No Next Gen Stats (separation, route info, etc.)
   - No snap counts visible
   - No target share data
   - **Workaround:** Use Next Gen Stats API separately

4. **Injury Reports** ⚠️
   - No dedicated `/injuries` endpoint found
   - Injury info may be embedded in roster or game data
   - **Action Required:** Deep dive into roster/game data to find injury status

5. **Weather Forecasts** ⚠️
   - Weather shown for games, but only current conditions
   - May not have forecasts for upcoming games
   - **Workaround:** Use Weather.com API for forecasts

### Minor Gaps

- Historical play-by-play (may be available via different endpoint)
- Practice reports
- Official injury reports (need to check game data)
- Betting line movement history
- Player rankings/projections

---

## Integration Plan

### Data Collection Strategy

**Priority 1: Real-time Game Data (During Games)**
```python
# Poll every 30 seconds during active games
async def poll_live_games():
    """Poll scoreboard for live game updates."""
    scoreboard = await fetch_espn_scoreboard()
    for game in scoreboard['events']:
        if game['status']['type']['state'] == 'in':
            # Game is live - extract data
            await process_live_game(game)
```

**Priority 2: Pre-game Data (Daily)**
```python
# Run once per day
async def sync_pregame_data():
    """Sync rosters, teams, upcoming games."""
    await sync_all_rosters()
    await sync_upcoming_games()
    await sync_news()
```

**Priority 3: Post-game Data (After Each Game)**
```python
# Run after games complete
async def sync_postgame_data(team_abbr):
    """Sync team stats after game completion."""
    await sync_team_statistics(team_abbr)
```

### Suggested Update Frequencies

| Data Type | Update Frequency | Priority |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Live Scoreboard | 30 seconds | CRITICAL (during games) |
| Upcoming Games | 1 hour | HIGH |
| Team Rosters | Daily | MEDIUM |
| Team Statistics | After each game | MEDIUM |
| News Feed | 15 minutes | LOW |

## Sample Usage Code

### Basic Accessor Pattern

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List
import aiohttp

class ESPNDataAccessor:
    """Data accessor for ESPN API."""

    BASE_URL = "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl"

    async def fetch_scoreboard(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Fetch current week scoreboard."""
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(f"{self.BASE_URL}/scoreboard") as resp:
                if resp.status == 200:
                    return await resp.json()
                raise Exception(f"ESPN API error: {resp.status}")

    async def fetch_team_roster(self, team_abbr: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Fetch roster for a specific team."""
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            url = f"{self.BASE_URL}/teams/{team_abbr}/roster"
            async with session.get(url) as resp:
                if resp.status == 200:
                    return await resp.json()
                raise Exception(f"ESPN API error: {resp.status}")

    async def get_live_games(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get all currently live games."""
        scoreboard = await self.fetch_scoreboard()
        live_games = []

        for event in scoreboard.get('events', []):
            status = event['status']['type']['state']
            if status == 'in':  # Game is live
                live_games.append(event)

        return live_games
```

## Go/No-Go Decision

### ✅ **GO** - ESPN API Approved as TIER 1 Data Source

**Justification:**

1. **Reliability:** 100% endpoint success rate
2. **Completeness:** Comprehensive game, team, and player data
3. **Freshness:** Real-time updates during games
4. **Cost:** Free with no authentication
5. **Performance:** Fast response times
6. **Stability:** ESPN's infrastructure is battle-tested

**Critical Gap Mitigation:**

The ESPN API lacks player prop odds, which is a critical gap for our use case. However:
- ESPN provides the foundation: games, players, stats, context
- We will supplement with PrizePicks API or The Odds API for prop lines
- ESPN's strength is in real-time game data and player information
- This combination approach (ESPN + prop source) is the optimal strategy

**Integration Priority:** HIGHEST (Start building ESPN accessor first)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Research Complete** - ESPN API validated
2. ⏭️ **Deep Dive Required:**
   - Check if injury data is embedded in roster/game responses
   - Test scoreboard endpoint during live game to verify update frequency
   - Explore if player game logs are available via different endpoints

3. ⏭️ **Build ESPN Accessor** (src/data/accessors/espn/)
   - Implement full ESPN data accessor
   - Add caching layer (Redis)
   - Add error handling and retries
   - Add data validation (Pydantic models)

4. ⏭️ **Move to Next Source:** Sleeper API research
